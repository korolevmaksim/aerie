# Aerie

**A desktop app that runs your local AI coding agents on a GitHub commit or PR, then posts the review back to GitHub — under your explicit confirmation.**

Aerie is GitHub mission-control for developers who already run AI coding-agent CLIs
(Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, and more). Instead of copy-pasting diffs into a
terminal, you browse your repos, pick a commit or PR, choose an agent + a review prompt,
and Aerie checks the change out locally, runs the agent against it, streams the output
live, and — only when you confirm — posts the result as a commit comment, PR comment, or
issue.

The agents run **locally, on your machine, against an app-owned clone**. Your GitHub token
never leaves the main process and is never handed to an agent.

> Status: early but functional (v0.1). macOS-first, cross-platform by design.

---

## Why

The commodity GitHub features (Actions, PR dashboards, analytics) already exist. Aerie's
one job is the part nothing else does well: **turn the local AI coding agents you already
have into a first-class GitHub review loop**, without shipping your code or token to a
third-party service.

## Features

- **Multi-account GitHub** — add one or more Personal Access Tokens; tokens are encrypted
  at rest with the OS keychain (`safeStorage`) and never cross into the UI.
- **Browse repos, commits, and PRs** — cached with conditional requests (ETags), so
  re-listing costs ~0 rate limit.
- **Local checkout** — Aerie clones into an app-owned working copy (or, opt-in, a
  read-only worktree of your own clone) and builds the unified diff for the agent.
- **Review your working tree before the PR** — point an agent at the **uncommitted**
  changes in your mapped local clone (all changes via `git diff HEAD`, or just what's
  staged) for a pre-PR pass. Zero GitHub calls, no checkout, never touches your working
  copy — read-only `git diff` only.
- **Edit your own agents** — the Tools tab has an in-app editor to add, clone, edit, and delete
  custom agent CLIs (the full contract: command, args, env, output capture, …). A user-added agent
  must be **explicitly approved** before Aerie will run its command — editing the command re-requires
  approval — and a custom agent can never shadow a built-in.
- **Spots coding CLIs you haven't wired** — the Tools tab also flags coding-agent CLIs found on your
  PATH that Aerie has no agent for yet (a **"Detected, not configured"** list) with an **Add as
  agent** shortcut that opens the editor prefilled — so a newly-installed CLI surfaces even before a
  template ships. These hints are inert: nothing runs until you create and approve an agent.
- **Run any local agent** — a small, editable registry ships templates for Codex,
  Claude Code, Cursor Agent, opencode, Kimi, Gemini, Mistral Vibe, Grok, Antigravity, and
  MiMo. Installed agents are auto-detected; pick a model and (where supported) a
  reasoning/thinking level per agent.
- **Reviews grounded in local tools** — before an agent reviews a change, Aerie runs your
  installed, change-relevant quality tools (ESLint, oxlint, Biome, `tsc`, Ruff, Bandit, yamllint,
  actionlint, Gitleaks) 100% locally, scopes their findings to the diff, de-duplicates them, and
  hands them to the agent as ground truth to confirm/refute/merge — so it triages real findings
  instead of inventing noise. Best-effort; toggle off in Settings → "Ground reviews with local tools".
- **Curated review prompts, out of the box** — Default, Security audit, Tests & edge
  cases, Performance, Architecture & maintainability, and Quick triage. Edit them or add
  your own in Settings, then pick one per run. Aerie always prepends the machine context
  (repo, SHA, working-copy + diff paths) so a custom prompt can never leave the agent
  without something to review.
- **Structured findings** — each review also extracts the agent's concrete findings (file, line,
  severity, message) into a compact list under the review; the raw block is kept out of the posted
  comment. Sets up cross-agent consensus across a panel.
- **Panel review (multi-agent) + consensus** — flip on "Panel review" to run one change through
  several agents at once; each streams its own review side by side (up to 3 run concurrently, the
  rest queue). A **Consensus** view then shows the issues that ≥K of the agents agree on (by code
  location) — a second opinion, and a way to see what's worth trusting, in one click.
- **Presets** — save an agent + model + reasoning bundle and apply it in one click.
- **Live output, kill, and history** — watch the agent's transcript stream, stop a run,
  and reopen any past run's logs and result. Search history by repo, agent, SHA, PR, status, or
  author, and narrow it to one repository.
- **Command palette (Cmd/Ctrl-K)** — fuzzy-jump to any view, account, or repo without reaching
  for the mouse.
- **Automate (pipelines)** — an **Automate** view that watches a repo's default branch on a local
  poll (never a webhook) and, on a new commit, runs your chosen agents, aggregates their findings,
  and then **notifies**, **stages** the result for you to post, or — only when you flip a per-pipeline
  opt-in — **auto-posts** it. **Create/edit pipelines** in-app (repo, trigger, agent steps, scope
  filters, and the action) — choosing **Post** reveals an explicit auto-post toggle gated behind a
  distinct danger confirm. The list shows each pipeline's live run status, an enable toggle,
  **Run now** / **Dry run** buttons, and an expandable **run history**; a dry run never writes to
  GitHub regardless of the opt-in.
  Auto-post is off by default and enforced in the main process.
- **Post back to GitHub — behind a confirm** — every write (commit comment, PR comment, or
  new issue) requires an explicit in-app confirmation showing the exact body. Optionally
  `@`-mention the commit/PR author.

## Security model

Aerie handles GitHub tokens and spawns local processes, so the boundaries are deliberate:

- `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`. The renderer is UI
  only — it never imports Node, touches tokens, or shells out.
- All GitHub, git, token, and agent work happens in the **main process**. The renderer
  reaches it solely through a small, typed `contextBridge` IPC surface.
- Tokens are encrypted at rest via Electron `safeStorage`, are never sent to the renderer,
  never written to a log, and are **never** placed in an agent's environment.
- Agents run on **app-owned clones** by default, not your working copies (read-only
  worktree mode is opt-in, default off).
- **Every** GitHub write sits behind an explicit confirmation dialog.

## Supported agents

Agent templates are plain config (`agents.json` in the app's user-data dir) — adding or
editing one is a config edit, not a code change. Ships with templates for:

`codex` · `claude-code` · `cursor-agent` · `opencode` · `kimi` · `gemini` · `vibe`
(Mistral) · `grok` · `agy` (Antigravity) · `mimo`.

Each template was tuned for a **clean, headless, read-only** review invocation (only the
final review is captured — no chat UI or tool-call transcript in the posted comment). You
only see and can run the agents whose CLI is actually installed on your PATH.

Beyond those, Aerie ships a broader **detection catalog** of agent-CLI templates that appear
automatically when their binary is on your PATH (and vanish when it isn't). You can extend it
with your own without touching `agents.json` by dropping an `agentCatalog.json` (a
`{ "schemaVersion": 1, "agents": [ …templates… ] }` file) into the app's user-data dir; those
entries likewise surface only when detected. Because they aren't author-shipped, a catalog
entry must be **explicitly approved once** (the same exec-consent prompt as a user-edited
agent) before it can run.

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 20.19** (CI runs on Node 22; see `.nvmrc`).
- A **C/C++ toolchain** — `better-sqlite3` is a native module rebuilt for Electron on
  install:
  - macOS: `xcode-select --install`
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools (Desktop C++) + Python 3
  - Linux: `build-essential` + `python3`
- At least one supported agent CLI installed and authenticated, if you want to run real
  reviews. (The registry ships a real-agent-only set; install whichever you use.)

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/korolevmaksim/aerie.git
cd aerie
npm install            # postinstall rebuilds better-sqlite3 for Electron
npm run dev            # run the app in development
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run typecheck      # tsc (node + web projects)
npm run lint           # eslint
npm test               # vitest (pure-logic unit tests)
npm run build          # typecheck + bundle (electron-vite)
npm run build:unpack   # build an unpacked app into release/
```

### Packaging a macOS app

Builds are **unsigned** by default. To produce a local unsigned build, disable
electron-builder's signing auto-discovery:

```bash
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run build:mac
```

Because the build is unsigned/un-notarized, macOS Gatekeeper will warn on first launch —
right-click the app → **Open**, or clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Aerie.app
```

(On Windows an unsigned build triggers SmartScreen → **More info → Run anyway**.)

## Using it

1. **Add an account** — paste a GitHub PAT (classic or fine-grained). It's validated and
   encrypted locally.
2. **Pick a repo**, then a **commit or PR**.
3. (Optional) **Prepare a local checkout** to pre-clone.
4. Choose an **agent**, **model**, **reasoning level**, and a **review prompt** (or apply a
   preset), then **Review with agent**.
5. Watch the live transcript. When it finishes, **Post as commit/PR comment** or **Create
   issue** — confirm the exact body (optionally tag the author) and it's posted.

### Configuring agents & prompts

- **Agents** — Settings shows the path to `agents.json`; edit it to add an agent, change a
  command, or adjust model/flags. Per-agent model and reasoning choices are stored
  separately and persist.
- **Prompts** — Settings → **Review prompts**: edit the defaults or add focused prompts;
  the picker on the run screen selects one per review. Power users can reference
  `{{repo}}`, `{{sha}}`, `{{repoPath}}`, `{{diffFile}}` placeholders in a prompt body.

## Roadmap / non-goals

v1 is intentionally focused on the review loop. Out of scope for now: Actions/workflow
dashboards, analytics, org-admin actions, GitHub writes beyond commit/PR comments +
optional issue creation, and real-time webhooks — GitHub already does those well.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). In short: keep the
security boundaries intact, run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` before a
PR, and match the existing TypeScript-strict, English-comment style.
